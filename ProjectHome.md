The Five Point Pose Estimation Evaluation Open Source Project is the product of a computer vision class project at CMU investigating several pose estimation techniques.

We offer a MATLAB implementation of Nister's Five Point Algorithm as well as several test statistics. The code is free and open source for any noncommercial, research use.

Also (currently in the works) is an end-to-end pose estimation system that uses this algorithm's implementation.
